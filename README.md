# prime_weekend_01

This project successfully meets the basic requirements of logging each employee's information, and adding those results to the web page, while also having the console return the budget requirement for all monthly salaries as the total entries are updated. Additionally, "Hard Mode" requirements have been met by adding a delete button to each section appended to the DOM, which will remove only that section from the DOM. 

Project currently stalled at "Pro Mode" which I have not begun coding for yet.
