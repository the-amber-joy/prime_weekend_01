# prime_weekend_01

This project successfully meets the basic requirements of logging each employee's information, and adding those results to the web page, while also having the console return the budget requirement for all monthly salaries as the total entries are updated.

Project stalled at "Hard Mode" as I attempted to add a "Remove" button for each entry. I still think my jQuery is correct and blame gremlins for its failing to work.

"Pro Mode" has not yet been attempted.
